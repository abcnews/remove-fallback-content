# Remove fallback content

A little code snippet that can be added to ease the use of fallback content which should be removed if the viewing environment supports javascript.

To use it, surround the content that should be removed in `#remove` and `#endremove` tags. For example:

```
Keep this par!
#remove
But remove this one.
#endremove
```
